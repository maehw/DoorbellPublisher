# Doorbell Gateway MQTT Publisher

## Introduction

This is a DIY [ESP8266](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESP8266)-based doorbell detector and gateway.

(It is similar to the older project [doorbell-gateway](https://github.com/maehw/doorbell-gateway) but it also provides a graphical OLED display.)

The idea is that a microphone and a small pre-conditioning circuit prepares an analogue signal to be sampled and converted to digits by the controller (by its integrated analog-digital converter, ADC). The digital voltage signal is then subtracted by a user-defined offset and a simple algorithm is used to detect the ring of the doorbell by setting an amplitude threshold.

On every ring the software posts a configurable MQTT message which can then be used to switch on a buzzer, blink some LEDs, send you an email or a notification on your smartphone, ... - ideas are endless.

The code has been written in the Arduino IDE as it provides simple, ready-to-use libraries.



## Hardware setup

I've been using an ESP-12E (NodeMCU 1.0) which uses an ESP8266. Other boards might be compatible as well.

The additional signal conditioning circuit is based on the [Claplight MKII 2017](https://kitbuilding.org/index.php?option=com_virtuemart&view=productdetails&virtuemart_product_id=90&virtuemart_category_id=12&lang=en) (PCB and parts in a kit) made by [kitbuilding.org](https://kitbuilding.org/index.php?lang=en). The kit can be bought for ~4 â‚¬ from their web-shop (they sell other great soldering kits, too!).

This part of the schematic is based on an 2N3906 PNP bipolar transistor:

The kit is originally powered by a 9V battery. Instead of using an additional battery, the supply voltage can be connected to the 3V3 pin of the NodeMCU board directly, too - also thanks to the voltage divider R5/R6 where you can lift the mid-supply to an arbitrary value. The GND signal also needs to be connected to the NodeMCU board. The NodeMCU board itself can be powered by a USB power supply or power bank.

The analog trigger signal is connected to the analog input signal pin `AD0` of the NodeMCU board.

The hardware setup looks like the following:

## Software setup

### Sensor software setup

Please change the settings in the file `config.h` according to your local setup:

- WiFi settings
  - SSID
  - Password
- MQTT settings
  (the sensor acts as an MQTT publishing client only)
  - Server (IP or hostname)
  - Port
  - Topic
  - Message to be sent on connect event
  - Message to be sent on doorbell detection event
- Hardware-specific settings
  - Pin number of analog input pin
  - Sensor loop delay/ query interval
  - Sensor offset voltage
  - Sensor threshold voltage
  - Sensor detection threshold

Then open the `.ino` file in the Arduino IDE, re-compile and upload it to your target uC.

### Subscriber software setup

As the sensor publishes MQTT messages there needs to be an MQTT client that subscribes these messages.

There's a list of MQTT libraries on github: https://github.com/mqtt/mqtt.github.io/wiki/libraries

For my local Linux PC I've used the `mosquitto-clients` package as test setup. The commands `mosquitto_sub` and `mosquitto_pub` can be used to play around.

You may want to restart the service:

```
sudo service mosquitto restart
```



Pipe it through `ts` in order to prepend every line with a timestamp:

```
$ mosquitto_sub -h localhost -p 1883 -t doorbell | ts
```



Or why not play a sound file remotely?

```
$ mosquitto_sub -h localhost -p 1883 -t doorbell_connection | xargs -i play -q /usr/share/sounds/KDE-Im-Message-In.ogg
$ mosquitto_sub -h localhost -p 1883 -t doorbell | xargs -i play -q /usr/share/sounds/doorbell.wav
```
